Since GitHub start dictating me how to do my hobby (especially trying to force me enable 2fa). I decided to move all my repositoties from GitHub. I'm not a Microsoft employee, not their slave. I and only I decide what and how to do in my spare time. I do not need electronic collars, etc. I'm not a child to restrict me. Eat your theathe of security youself! 

I suggest anyone to do the same. No forced 'management assistance' in open source development! Details https://github.com/667bdrm/stop-using-github

Repository moved to https://gitlab.com/667bdrm/sofiactl

All repositories available at https://gitlab.com/667bdrm/ &lt;repository name&gt;
If you don't see the repository on GitLab, that means that repository's changes merged with upstream and fork no more needed.
